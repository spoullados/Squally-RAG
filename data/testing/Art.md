Leaving the lecture theatre we see that the solitary wooden 
figure balancing precariously in a kneeling position on its sphere in 
the small foyer illuminated by a sole skylight is part of a group of 
Josef Felix Müller | Untitled, 1989, three parts, wood and mosaic, mixed media
works by Josef Felix Müller (born 1955). The male figure is peering in 
the direction of the narrow corridor connecting the Auditorium 
Maximum and the library. At the end of the corridor it catches sight 
of a counterpart positioned on a small balcony of the upper-storey 
gallery. This figure is female and anchored firmly to its crude 
pedestal. It is not alone, standing back to back with a second male 
figure on a coarsely hewn tree trunk. Looking back from here we see 
above the figure on the sphere a blue wall piece with a star which, 
behind a platform bridging the corridor, rises like a piece of an 
artificial, emblematic sky. Only when we get closer do we see that the 
star is a mosaic made up of different parts. This calls to mind a hero’s 
story from Greek mythology, in which on the advice of the Goddess 
Athena, Kadmos used the teeth of a slain dragon as seed. The dragon 
seed produced armed warriors. One might ask which seed of man the 
mosaic with the teeth of cattle, horses, deer and sharks references.
The entire group of works appears as encrypted and self-referential as the star’s symbolism: The two figures staring at each other 
are at an unbridgeable distance from one another and define the 
space between them, while the third, male figure is turning away and 
cannot communicate with the female figure to the back of him. 

We now proceed along the connecting corridor and pass 
through a glass door on the left into the large new library. The 
bookshelves and workstations extend across two floors, with various 
areas in the open space meeting the students’ needs. Surrounded by 
reading desks, in the middle there stands a painted bronze sculpture 
by Mimmo Paladino (born 1948), “Giardino chiuso” (p. 82). It is 
directly beneath the tip of the glass pyramid in the middle of the 
room such that, especially when viewed from the gallery on the 
upper storey, it is an eye-catcher. It is no coincidence that in the 
midst of books and interpreted texts there is an extremely pictorial 
sculpture with a pronounced narrative texture. By means of diffuse 
symbolism and vague formal borrowing from African art, it references the Greek legend of Charon and Dante’s description of him. 
According to legend, Charon, the old ferryman, carried the souls of 
the newly deceased across the River Styx to the world of the dead. A 
reference to the finite nature of all that is terrestrial in the centre of 
the library.
Four sets of stairs connect the two floors of the library with 
each other, while the wide staircase opposite the main entrance leads 
to the Auditorium Maximum. Having reached the last step we now 
encounter a large, two-part picture, a vibrating colour surface, 
“Illusionen” by Gerhard Richter (born 1932). A few years ago the 
artist gave the picture a new name: “St.Gallen”. The colour of the 
painting, which is almost as big as the wall, is if anything restrained, 
at least as far as the final coating, which was applied vertically in 
black and white, is concerned. In innumerable places, however, the 
surface is torn and scratched, such that the coloured layers of sediment beneath the picture are visible. On the left-hand side of the 
picture the exposed places reveal a fiery red which breaks through 
the outer layers of paint, while on the right the turbulent colouring 
slowly gives way to a duller brownish red, an ochre hue, and green.
It is well known that Gerhard Richter repeatedly revises his 
works in a lengthy process, each condition representing an independent development, which he examines, without, however, planning the 
further steps. Richter has not only painted abstract pictures, on the 
outside his output is characterised far more by constant change and 
apparent caesuras. In the 1960s he began painting pictures based on 
photos from magazines.
In the by no means artistic photographs Richter found a way 
of liberating himself from the compulsion of intentional aesthetic 
creation. This process is reminiscent of the strategy that Marcel 
Duchamp developed in his ready-mades.
In contrast to Duchamp, who abandoned painting, Richter 
attempts to open up new possibilities for himself in precisely this 
field. He does this by emptying the mimetic content of figurative 
pictures in his oeuvre, and by taking the physicalism of colour, which 
refers to nothing other than itself, to absurd levels. Though as of the 
1970s the focal point of his interest seemed to shift to abstract painting, he never on this account stopped painting figurative pictures as 
well. In this sense, he never differentiated between representational 
and non-representational paintings, as neither can ever be similar to 
the object they represent. Realistic works are often just symbols and 
have a referential character aimed not directly at what is portrayed in 
the picture, but at something that lies behind. They are not different 
from abstract pictures, as these can both refer to cosmic orders and 
represent colour spaces, or be colour that celebrates itself in the act of 
painting. If the referential character is already so fragile, what if 
anything can one rely on in a picture? Aesthetic experience, as 
Gerhard Richter’s pictures teach us, is not geared towards the 
recognition of reality, we do not learn anything about the world by 
observing art. It is, however, one of man’s independent assets. Art 
guides us to reflected judgements and shows us our own possibilities 
of perception.
Turning round we will see on the section of wall above the 
stairwell leading to the ground floor the wall piece “Anima” by 
Luciano Fabro (1936–2007). Thin, coloured metal rods of unequal 
lengths are collected as a bundle and fastened to a piece of the wall 
covered in white plaster. On the right, the weight bends the longer 
ends of the rods downwards to create a springy arc, shaped by a light 
touch. On the left, toward the window, colourful, slightly bent metal 
strips have been attached to the rods as a counterweight, hanging 
vertically downwards. The fine, golden wires that lead from the point 
where these shorter pendulums link to the longer rods up to the left 
upper corner of the wall are as good as invisible. The wall piece 
evolves using sparing, but highly effective means, whereby the 
essential element that constitutes it is the weightlessness of balance. 
The rods are deliberately garish in colour, making the piece seem 
bright and transparent, so that it looks as bodiless as possible in the 
incident daylight. Luciano Fabro was initially associated with “Arte 
Povera”, albeit not just using plain, but also decidedly precious 
materials.
Thanks to the elegance of the gestures and the lively colours, 
“Anima” has a radiant sense of lightness about it, all too easily 
making one forget that in his almost intangible piece, which repeat
edly takes on new, unexpected shapes, Fabro addresses fundamental 
questions of human existence and explores the metaphysical properties of the artwork. The title “Anima” perhaps alludes to this, referencing the Latin for a breath of air, for breath, an appropriate attribute for the way the work seems to float above the stairs, and to the 
same word as the designation of the soul as the source of organicsensory life as opposed to intellectual inspiration.
As in the entrance hall, on the upper floor the foyer along the 
curved real wall of the main lecture theatre is also accessible, whereby along the gallery railing there are comfortable chairs inviting you 
to tarry awhile, with windows in front providing ample light. From 
here there’s a great view of the centre of the mural by Enzo Cucchi 
(born 1949). The painting is composed of a layer of plaster and honey 
and spreads across the entire length and breadth of the wall. The 
curvature in the composition is discernible when you look at the 
image’s central figure – an embryo-like being with an outsised 
double head; with its back to us it steps into the depths of the picture. 
It appears at this point to both scatter the pictorial content and to 
hold it together. The notion of a stable axis is emphasized by the 
drop-like shape made of tar, which descends upon the above described figure and the cloverleaf emanating from its head. This is 
highlighted by the other elements in the image (three staggered rows 
one behind the other, likewise of head shapes divided in the middle 
and nine drops or rays tapering toward the edges) again intimating a 
movement that accelerates outwards and which we viewers associate 
with the curve of the wall. Enzo Cucchi’s pictorial world thrives on 
portrayals of archetypes that he seems to cull from some collective 
unconscious. Perhaps he also refers ironically to the activity behind 
the wall in the lecture theatre, where students with hypertrophic 
brains sit in rows of seats staring captivated at the centre, whence the 
knowledge radiates outwards. In his large-format paintings with 
their complex compositional schemes, Cucchi manages to conjure up 
enigmatic visions of the end of time from the depths of his own 
intuition. 

A piece from Felice Varini, an artist living in Paris but originally from Ticino (*1952 in Locarno), was installed in the top floor of 
the library building in 2014. “Dix disques évidés plus neuf moitiés et 
deux quarts” challenges and sharpens our perception of dimensions, 
shifting it from three to two and then back, whereby our visual 
acclimatisation is well and truly scrambled. It also pleases the 
illusionist Varini if we do not even discover the two-dimensional 
resolution and the floating planes, thus failing to solve the riddle. 
The concept of ‘art in architecture’ is perfectly embodied here 
– in between installation art and painting. Felice Varini works in open 
space with simple geometric forms and primary colours, which 
reveal themselves to the observer from a single point. A small 
movement is enough to resolve the system. Together, the supposed 
fragmentary chaos and the geometric, static order contained within 
only reveal the dialectic whole in an endless loop of de- and reconstruction. It is always possible to return to the one point and escape 
the chaos. Upon the first encounter with the red fragments in the 
three-dimensional space, we inevitably ask ourselves whether there 
is something there which we have yet to notice. Varini consciously 
chooses simplicity of form and colour, because our steps and perception already create a sufficient sense of unease that surrounds the 
artwork. 
The red, painted on backgrounds, is complemented by 
transparent film on the windows, which further intensifies the 
playful, distortive effects created by the invasion of light and finds 
new spaces through the illuminating red projections, even on the 
ground floor. Across thirty years of creativity and counting, Varini 
finds surfaces on which to cast his projections almost all over the 
world on walls, façades, floors, concrete piers, gates, windows, 
balustrades. His entirely personal dramaturgy, an anamorphosis, 
soon teaches us that all insight is a matter of perspective. 
Closely coupled with the architecture, the installation creates 
an unexpected connection to another artwork in the neighbouring 
main building. The red mobile by Alexander Calder, with its organic 
forms, is constantly moving and generates various constellations of 
sculptures and pictures in two and three dimensions – both autonomously and through the constantly changing perspective of the 
observers passing by. The red pliage by Gottfried Honegger at the 
Kirchenhoferhaus also changes markedly with each step we take, 
generating a different geometric figure.
